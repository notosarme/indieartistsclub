A website that spawned from a collective that wanted to create a simple resource hub, as artistic resources of this sort are often very scattered online. One of the main things is that they wished to keep the website as "vanilla" and lightweight as possible, for three main reasons:

1. To be accessible to as many people as possible, particularly considering this demographic is known to have many low income users and youth in it.
2. To be able to be easily passed on to someone else if needed, with the assumption this person would have mid-to-low tech knowledge, and would need something simple to learn.
3. To be able to openly show the source code and show others how simple it is to create a functional website, thus encouraging users of this demographic to have more independence in their online spaces.
