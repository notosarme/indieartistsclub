                    or porn of minors or animals is banned, going by Australian
                    law. They take a $1.50 + 8% fee, and accept all major cards
                    & PayPal from clients in almost every country, and allow you
                    to withdraw in your own currency. They do not charge a

                    might.

                      who considered that auctioning art was way too
                      inconvenient with the existing options. Also, we believe
                      that people do not only want to buy art from artists they
                      know but discover new people who make great art.

                      on the homepage until they're finished and archived. This
                      makes the system very useful to discover new art, hunt for
                      a good bargain and to give exposure to artists who are
                      selling their art.</i

                    protect against adoptable drama, like "refund take back"
                    being banned. You can also list rules around your
                    adoptables, but they are not enforcable by YCH, which
                    instead takes the stance that the buyer has full rights to
                    the character. You can resell if you own a character, with
                    specific rules around that as well.

                      platform for artists and commissioners to work with each
                      other without the frustration of ad-hoc solutions to
                      tracking outstanding work, finding available artists, and

                    A furry-focused site, split into Clean, Risque, Adult
                    (vanilla porn), and Offensive (disturbing). They feature

                    "non-art content" and explicit photos or photomanips of
                    humans, though you must strictly tag your content. They
                    offer free, basic, and landscape plans - free plans allow
                    you to track one order at a time. Their transaction fees
                    are... confusing, but don't seem too bad. There's a
                    calculator available so you can see how much in fees you
                    will accrue per price you set. It seems to be like other

                    A more "local" style digital art commission site with an
                    emphasis on portaits and pet drawings. What is interesting
                    about it is that it has built-in

                    There's a strict content policy - nothing sexually explicit
                    or "abusive". They take a massive 30% transaction fee, but
                    do cover Paypal fees for you, at least. They also have an

                    Custom art commission website that has a more "local" bias
                    to it. It does allow NSFW content, as there is a toggle for
                    it on the homescreen... though their TOS says they do not
                    allow pornographic or sexually explicit content. The website
                    attempts to connect customers to artists that match the
                    specific thing they request... so there is a focus on
                    "standardization". Good for if you want to advertise a
                    specific style or gimmick. There is a basic print-on-demand
                    service offered to Americans. They use Paypal only, there is
                    a 15% transaction fee, and there is a minimum $10
                    withdrawal.

                    A very formal website, the average price people charge for
                    commissions on this site seems to be $400. Clients put out
                    requests which artists can answer with proposals. You have
                    to apply to be on the website with a portfolio, and there is
                    apparently a fee associated with it.

                    A freelancing site that allows you to provice pretty much
                    any digital service. While very big, it's not usually
                    recommended as it is a worldwide site where you will often
                    be undercut by people from countries that can undercharge
                    you by a wide margin. Does not allow "inappropriate" or
                    adult services. There is a 20% fee on each gig.

                    A very popular website for receiving tips (donations),
                    commissions, and monthly memberships. You can provide any
                    service, physical or digital. There is a gallery option for
                    your page, and you can sell fixed digital content there as
                    well. They take a 5% fee, or 0% if you pay for their premium
                    membership (it's also 0% on donations for everyone, though
                    you still get hit with Paypal/Stripe fees). They do not
                    allow pornography, nudity, obscene, or violent content.

                    A Japanese website that requires a Japanese bank account to
