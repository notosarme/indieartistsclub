There is a gallery option for your page, and you can sell fixed digital content there as well.

You can sell physical goods, digital goods, and even do art commissions through it. It just is done in a more hands-on way - emailing the client after they pay you to get the details, or requesting they email you. They allow NSFW content, though censor it in your storefront display."
