              <p>
                Welcome! We're a group of online indie artists who wanted to
                create a resource hub for other indie artists. The main aspect
                of this club is the list of resources, so if that's all you're
                interested in, please enjoy! We'd love if you'd leave a comment
                in the guestbook too ‚ù§
              </p>
              <p>
                There is, however, a deeper aspect to this club. For a long
                while, but particularly over the past few years, we've found
                severe anti-artist sentiments online - and not just from the
                tech bros or "anti-pretentious creatives" types, though they
                certainly don't help matters. Even people who claim to be
                artists or art enjoyers themselves have shown dislike or
                outright hatred for art that goes beyond simple aesthetics. This
                has correlated with the rise of anti-intellectualism,
                illiteracy, and incuriosity plaguing people online. In essence,
                <b
                  >we reject the push for art of all forms to be reduced down to
                  easily consumable content.</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This does not mean we are anti-tech, or against people making
                money off art. Not at all! But we hope that for more people, art
                will again be about their internal worlds, their emotions, a way
                of viewing the world, and not about the cult of content creation
                and dopamine hacking.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hope to create ways to connect people with similar feelings
                as well in the future. For now this site is a work in process.
                Please enjoy it for what it is.
